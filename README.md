# game-dev

In this repo I'm developing my own 2D game engine. I've originally followed the learnopengl.com Breakout tutorial but then I've decided to rewrite some code such as replacing glew and glad libraries for SDL.

Right now I'm focusing on adding ECS to the base engine to later develop some games to test and develop more features as the games require them.
